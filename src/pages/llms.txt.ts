It reads the date each photo was taken from its EXIF data (DateTimeOriginal), falls back to the file's date, and lets the user change any date. Styles: a white date with a thin black outline, a dark label, and the orange retro date of 90s film cameras. It handles many photos at once and saves them to a folder (desktop Chrome/Edge), to the phone's gallery (share sheet), or as separate downloads, with an optional ZIP.",
